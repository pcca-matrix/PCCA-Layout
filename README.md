# PCCA Hyperspin and Hyper-Theme conversion for Attract-Mode

### Version 2.50 beta

This script is intended to work with Attract-Mode http://attractmode.org/ , it intends to reproduce the real hyperspin experience in HD as precise as possible using the same themes and folder structure as a real Hyperspin setup.

Theme editor/creator can be used to build new themes in HD.

## Restrictions
It is MANDATORY to set in Attract-Mode options: General->Startup Mode to 'Show Display Menu' and Displays->'Display Menu Options->'Allow Exit from 'Display Menu' to 'No'.
PCCA theme has its own screensaver timer method, to avoid conflict set in the attractmode settings menu the screensaver timer to 0.
